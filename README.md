Search Engine Project

## Milestones
1. Create a website which will be used to house SARA, as well as other pertinent information (see
“Website/Homepage” below).
2. Display hard-coded search results about a topic of your choice.
3. Display search results read from files stored in CSV, JSON, and XML formats.
4. Display search results obtained from using the Google Search API (see e.g.
https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview)
5. Display search results from your own search engine which indexes the entire content of
webpages. (Details about the search engine will be provided later in the semesters when we
discuss databases and server-side programming.) Administration screens related to this search
engine will also be needed.
